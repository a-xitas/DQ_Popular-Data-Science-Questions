# Popular Data Science Questions
(exploring the family of Stack Exchange Websites)

# === Prelude ===

### The Stack Exchange Websites welcomes every type of questions related to the subject in matter. For example, the Stack Exchange Website related to Data Science is populated with questions and queries related to the subject of Data Science. They vary from how to plot a graph, to questions related to a programming language such as Python.

### The range of subdivisions on the Data Science Stack Exchange (DSSE) go from popular libraries like Pandas, Keras, Tensorflow to the programming language Python, passing trough Statistics, Predictive-modeling, Time-series, regression, etc.

### Apart from all this information, we can also explore all the Questions that were made in the website, and some data related to them, such as how many answers each question had, votes, views.

### Maybe we could take the approach of using as a proxy the most popular - most viewed, most answered, and most voted - questions/tags as one of the hottest topics for Data Science enthusiasts.
